This venn data visualization explores the incidence of observed mental health issues, legally obtained weapons and assault grade weapons relevant to all mass shootings that have taken place between 1982 - 2018 in the US. The project forms a component of my thesis project undertaken through the MPS Information Visualization at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA).
