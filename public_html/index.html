        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        The following venn diagrams aim to highlight, specifically, the unique and fragile confluence of factors that underscore mass shooting incidence in the USA.
        The specific focus of this work is to highlight the intersection between prior signs of mental health issues, use of legally obtained weapons and 
        use of assault weapons by perpetrators in mass shootings that have taken place within this time period. Arguably, as the venn diagrams 
        reveal, all three factors are powerful undercurrents that work together to successfully sustain the unrivaled trajectory of mass shooting incidence in the USA.  
        <br>
        <br>
        This analysis has been framed in the context of the price of the right to keep and bear arms in the USA. The second amendment states -
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."</div>
        <br>
        As the complexity of society increases a critical vulnerability exists at the intersection of the above three mentioned factors. The preservation of the right to
        keep and bear arms, for all American citizens, in its current form, comes at a severe and punishing expense to an 
        increasing number of American citizens. Their lives represent the ultimate price - a price paid unfairly and unjustly by the few to preserve the 
        right of many. A notion which contradicts sharply with the United States Declaration of Independence which states three unalienable rights endowed to all humans by
        their creator - Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.
