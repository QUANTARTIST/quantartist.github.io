        <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
        The following venn diagrams aim to highlight, specifically, the unqiue and fragile confluence of factors that underscore mass shooting incidence in the USA.
        The specific focus of this work is to highlight the intersection between prior signs of mental health issues, use of legally obtained weapons and 
        use of assault weapons by perpetrators in mass shootings that have taken place within this time period. Arguably, as the venn diagrams 
        reveal, all three factors are powerful undercurrents that work together to successfully sustain the unrivaled trajectory of mass shooting incidence in the USA.  
        <br>
        <br>
        This analysis has been framed in the context of the price of the right to keep and bear arms in the USA. The second amendement states -
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="quote">"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."</div>
        <br>
        As the complexity of society increases a critical vulnerability exists at the intersection of the above three mentioned factors. The preservation of the right to
        keep and bear arms, for all American citizens, in its current form, comes at a severe and punishing expense to an 
        increasing number of American citizens. Their lives represent the ultimate price - a price paid unfreely, unfairly and unjustly by the few to preserve the 
        entitlement of the many. A notion which contradicts sharply with the United States Declaration of Independence which states three unalienable rights endowed to all humans by
        their creator - Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.

        <h3>DATA</h3>
        The data reflected in the following venn diagrams has been sourced from - <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/">US Mass Shootings, 1982-2018: Data From Mother Jones’ Investigation</a>.
        The dataset was pulled from the latest updated version at Nov. 8, 2018, 8:05 a.m. PT. Full context and analysis of the data can be viewed at <a href = "https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/">A Guide to Mass Shootings in America.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a description of the criteria that Mother Jones has used to compile the dataset:
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;">
<li>The perpetrator took the lives of at least four people.</li>
<li>A 2008 FBI report identifies an individual as a mass murderer—versus a spree killer or a serial killer—if he kills four or more people in a single incident (not including himself), 
  typically in a single location. (*In 2013, the US government’s fatality baseline was revised down to three.)</li>
<li>The killings were carried out by a lone shooter. (Except in the case of the Columbine massacre and the Westside Middle School killings, which involved two shooters.)</li>
<li>The shootings occurred in a public place. (Except in the case of a party on private property in Crandon, Wisconsin, and another in Seattle, where crowds of strangers 
  had gathered, essentially constituting a public crowd.) Crimes primarily related to gang activity or armed robbery are not included, nor are mass killings that took place in 
  private homes (often stemming from domestic violence).</li>
<li>Perpetrators who died or were wounded during the attack are not included in the victim tallies.</li>
<li>Also included are a handful of cases also known as “spree killings“—cases in which the killings occurred in more than one location, 
  but still over a short period of time, that otherwise fit the above criteria.<br/><br/><br/></li>
</ul>
