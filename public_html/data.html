        <h3>DATA</h3>
        The data reflected in the following venn diagrams has been sourced from - <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/12/mass-shootings-mother-jones-full-data/">US Mass Shootings, 1982-2018: Data From Mother Jones’ Investigation</a>.
        The dataset was pulled from the latest updated version at Nov. 8, 2018, 8:05 a.m. PT. Full context and analysis of the data can be viewed at <a href = "https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/07/mass-shootings-map/">A Guide to Mass Shootings in America.</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is a description of the criteria that Mother Jones has used to compile the dataset:
        <br>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc; margin-left: 8px; margin-right: 8px;">
<li>The perpetrator took the lives of at least four people.</li>
<li>A 2008 FBI report identifies an individual as a mass murderer—versus a spree killer or a serial killer—if he kills four or more people in a single incident (not including himself), 
  typically in a single location. (*In 2013, the US government’s fatality baseline was revised down to three.)</li>
<li>The killings were carried out by a lone shooter. (Except in the case of the Columbine massacre and the Westside Middle School killings, which involved two shooters.)</li>
<li>The shootings occurred in a public place. (Except in the case of a party on private property in Crandon, Wisconsin, and another in Seattle, where crowds of strangers 
  had gathered, essentially constituting a public crowd.) Crimes primarily related to gang activity or armed robbery are not included, nor are mass killings that took place in 
  private homes (often stemming from domestic violence).</li>
<li>Perpetrators who died or were wounded during the attack are not included in the victim tallies.</li>
<li>Also included are a handful of cases also known as “spree killings“—cases in which the killings occurred in more than one location, 
  but still over a short period of time, that otherwise fit the above criteria.<br/><br/><br/></li>
</ul>
